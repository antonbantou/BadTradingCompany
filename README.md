University project semester 2
1st Checkpoint

My dear university fellows are creatures and as so forgot to actually declare this lesson 
due to entirely forgetting that they actually had to declare lessons at all. Therefore, 
much to my own disdain, from the team of two people - as I had stated in a lesson previously,
we were unable to find a third, it has become a one man project. I don't personally mind - 
and frankly, would rather I work on this myself. Don't want to work on a project that I
had no say in deciding the topic.

As it is, the program is barebones - most of my time was spent figuring out tkinter, and trying
to get the graph to update live. Not much luck yet - may simply implement a refresh button and 
make my life that much simpler. The program supports making accounts, which it saves locally on a txt
file, and can use this data to log in. Logging in brings you to the main screen.

The main screen shows a graph with the prices of bitcoin. Under it, obviously, is the current price.
By the end of the week, I plan to add a button to select a couple different coins, and a column to the right 
with the current currency in your wallet in raw USD, as well as current held coins and their translated
prices. Now that I've learnt how to actually use this god forsaken GUI program, it should be the least
of efforts.

Small setup required - needs to install requests, pandas, matplotlib libraries. Will set up a setup program 
soon enough.

Small algorithm to be made in the next week that will predict and advise the user when to purchase or sell.

Planned features:
  -First Time User guide
  -First Time User experience
  -General prettification
  -Actually getting the blasted graphs to update in real time.
