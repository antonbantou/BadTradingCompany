University project semester 2
1st Checkpoint

My dear university fellows are creatures and as so forgot to actually declare this lesson 
due to entirely forgetting that they actually had to declare lessons at all. Therefore, 
much to my own disdain, from the team of two people - as I had stated in a lesson previously,
we were unable to find a third, it has become a one man project. I don't personally mind - 
and frankly, would rather I work on this myself. Don't want to work on a project that I
had no say in deciding the topic.

As it is, the program is barebones - most of my time was spent figuring out tkinter, and trying
to get the graph to update live. Not much luck yet - may simply implement a refresh button and 
make my life that much simpler.
